# Face Detection Web Application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To test the functionality of this app, please log in using user name "test@gmail.com" and password "1234."

It might take a while to open the web due to the default setting of free Heroku dyno.

Right now it can successfully capture faces of any picture with a valid url. 
E.g. https://t3.ftcdn.net/jpg/00/97/37/60/240_F_97376014_41QZMwTYCMfqSBa1jSKHMUL9Uh7C9KB3.jpg (this is a royalty-free picture from Adobe Stock)
